# MesosTerm

**MesosTerm** is a web-based terminal for Mesos. It allows you to execute command
within Mesos containers (UCR only) from a web interface as you would do with
docker exec.

![The interactive web terminal](doc/images/mesos-term.png?raw=true "MesosTerm")

**WARNING**: you might face "Connection has been closed." error messages randomly
when using MesosTerm against Mesos version lower than 1.5.1. This is due to a
race condition mentioned in
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7742](MESOS-7742).
The solution is to upgrade Mesos to a version higher or equal to 1.5.1.

## Features

* Web-based container terminal.
* Authentication againt LDAP.
* Authorizations based on Mesos executor labels.

## Getting started

To set up a complete environment for testing, ensure docker and docker-compose
are installed on your machine and run:

```
./scripts/tests/setup.sh
```

And then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To get a task ID for running a terminal, you can get one from Marathon
available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). A few
applications have already been created for you.

## Use MesosTerm in production

To run MesosTerm in production you'll need to run the application
with several environment variables used to configure **MesosTerm**.

### Without authorizations

In order to use MesosTerm without authorizations, execute the following
command:

```
docker run --name mesos-term --rm -p 3000:3000 -it \
  -e JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret \
  -e MESOS_MASTER_URL=http://mesos-master:5050 \
  -e MESOS_STATE_CACHE_TIME=60 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret \
  clems4ever/mesos-term
```

### With authorizations

In order to use MesosTerm with authorizations, execute the following
command:

```
docker run --name mesos-term --rm -p 3000:3000 -it \
  -e SUPER_ADMINS=admins,harry \
  -e JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret \
  -e LDAP_BASE_DN=dc=yourldap,dc=com \
  -e LDAP_PASSWORD=the-admin-password \
  -e LDAP_URL=ldap://yourldap.com \
  -e LDAP_USER=cn=admin,dc=yourldap,dc=com \
  -e MESOS_MASTER_URL=http://mesos-master:5050 \
  -e MESOS_STATE_CACHE_TIME=60 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret \
  clems4ever/mesos-term
```

## Authorizations model

**MesosTerm** support a two-level authorization model allowing certain users
to be super-admins able to debug any container in Mesos and other users
considered as admins and defined per Mesos task.

Super-admins users must be mentionned in the SUPER\_ADMINS environment
as a comma-separated list of LDAP users and groups.

Admins users able to debug an applications must be mentionned as a comma-separated
list of LDAP users and groups in the DEBUG\_GRANTED\_TO task labels. Here is an
example using Marathon.

![authorized users](doc/images/authorizations.png?raw=true "Authorizations")

For security reasons, it has been decided to not allow admins of an application
to spawn a terminal in the case the Mesos task runs as `root` or no user
(meaning the user running Mesos, i.e., most probably `root`). Only super-admins
can debug those containers.

## Mesos state caching

For production Mesos cluster having a few thousands of instances, it might be
slow to retrieve the Mesos state in order to verify the permissions of a user
to spawn a terminal in a container. In order to improve the user experience,
the Mesos state is fetched regularly and cached. The cache is then invalidated
after some time defined by the environment variable called
MESOS\_STATE\_CACHE\_TIME and expressed in seconds.

You can set a big number in order to reduce the load of your Mesos cluster.
Though, it is important to know that **MesosTerm** automatically invalidate
the cache when a terminal is requested for a task that does not exist in
the cache. It allows users to run terminals in newly created instances that
might not be yet in the cache.
